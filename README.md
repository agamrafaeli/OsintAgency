# OsintAgency

OsintAgency monitors Telegram channels for mentions of the Quran and summarizes how passages are quoted across the network. The project collects the messages, normalizes the references, and exposes a dashboard that highlights recurring themes and channel-level trends.

## Current Status

The repository is under active build-out. Follow the plans in `agents/AGENTS_PLAN.md` and the coordination notes in `agents/AGENTS_README.MD` if you are contributing.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have the required Telegram data access credentials (Bot API or client session).
2. Install project dependencies (documentation pending).
3. Run the ingestion pipeline to populate the analysis store, then launch the dashboard service.
